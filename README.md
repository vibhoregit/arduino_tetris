# arduino_tetris
C_code implementing Tetris on an arduino running an 8x12 LED matrix 

Hi all, So this is a heavily optimised (sort of) implementation of Tetris.
The brains is arduino nano, the muscle is HC595 + TLC59213 combo and the
schematic and pcb is here at https://easyeda.com/jainvibhore1997/tetris

WARNING: THE PCB IS IN A HORRENDUS STATE, THERE ARE MANY PLACES THAT REQUIRE
BLUE WIRING SO I RECOMMEND LAYING OUT YOUR OWN PCB

The code was developed and compiled using AVR studio 5.1
Comments to code will be added soon (hopefully)
